<p>James Cox is a librarian-in-training with an interest in technology. 
He takes the "in-training" part of that seriously as he believes during 
the course of his career both libraries and technology will change 
drastically. Due to these projected changes, he will always be "in-training." 
Always learning and evolving to what the users of the library want 
and what is available to the library. </p>
<p>Currently a student at the University of Iowa School of Library and 
Information Science, James is continuing to learn what it means to be a 
librarian focusing on academic libraries, how users seek information, 
coding that can be used to store, visualize, and analyze information, 
and the ethics around the library having that information in the first place.</p>

section on the left of the screen. </p>
