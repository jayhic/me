<p>This is the part of the website where I attempt to humanize myself beyond 
just a CV and listing of my projects. I am a real person and I 
do real things that I really enjoy! My life has had ups, downs, left, and 
right turns. All of those have made me who I am today and I cannot think of 
a thing I would have done differently because I have no idea how that would 
have changed me!</p>
<p>Librarians and other people who work in libraries are all interesting 
people with a dizzying number of interests, hobbies, and experiences. But 
what I have noticed about them is that the majority took winding roads 
to become a librarian. Few said, "I wanted to be a librarian when I 
graduated high school." My path to where I am today is also a nonlinear 
path with changing goals, life experiences, and interests which makes me who 
I am today. These topics can be explored below.</p>
