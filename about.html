<p>This is the part of the website where I attempt to humanize myself beyond 
just a CV and listing of my projects. I am a real person and I 
do real things that I really enjoy! My life has had ups, downs, left, and 
right turns. All of those have made me who I am today and I cannot think of 
a thing I would have done differently because I have no idea how that would 
have changed me!</p>
<p>Librarians and other people who work in libraries are all interesting 
people with a dizzying number of interests, hobbies, and experiences. But 
what I have noticed about them is that the majority took winding roads 
to become a librarian. Few said, "I wanted to be a librarian when I 
graduated high school." My path to where I am today is also a nonlinear 
path with changing goals, life experiences, and interests which makes me who 
I am today. These topics can be explored below.</p>

<div id="Education" class="tabcontent">
	<p>For my winding road through education I need to start out as a freshman 
	in high school. I took a class called Introduction to Engineering Design. 
	One of the first homework assignments was to research 10 or so different 
	fields of engineering and describe them. From that assignment, I learned 
	about Aerospace Engineering and it sounded awesome! After that the plan 
	for all of high school was Aerospace Engineering.</p>
	<p>My first choice of college was the United States Naval Academy and 
	Iowa State University was my second choice. I received two nominations 
	for admission to the Naval Academy, one from Senator Grassley and one 
	from former Senator Harkin. But, with an acceptance rate of 9% I was 
	not admitted. Thankfully, the State of Iowa uses a formula to determine 
	admission and if a student's score is high enough they are automatically 
	accepted. Mine was and following high school I began as an Aerospace 
	Engineering Student at Iowa State University.</p>
	<img src="ISU.jpg" alt="ISU Football" style="float:right;padding-bottom: 10px;padding-left:25px;width:150px;height:150px;">
	<p>While at Iowa State I greatly enjoyed my freshman year. The program 
	talked about high level concepts of Aerospace Engineering, we did cool 
	projects, and basic computer programming with Fortran and MATLAB. When 
	my sophomore year started the class began to be taught what Aerospace 
	Engineering was and how that process gets done. It quickly became apparent 
	that engineering was not for me. I decided to withdraw from Iowa State.</p>
	<p>At this point in my education I had no idea what to do, as for the 
	last 5+ years of my life the plan had been Aerospace Engineering. That 
	summer I asked myself what did I enjoy and thinking over my high school 
	education I decided I had enjoyed History. The next thought I had was 
	"So, I get a history degree then what...What is my plan with that?" and 
	I decided on a librarian. My thought was I liked helping people learn 
	but I didn't want to grade homework so a librarian made sense to me.</p>
	<p>After a semester at Kirkwood Community College I transferred the 
	credits I had earned there and my credits from Iowa State to the 
	University of Iowa, they had the graduate program that I wanted to get 
	into so it made sense to go there for my undergraduate degree. I then 
	began to work towards my degree in History.</p>
	<p>There is not an undergraduate library science program or classes 
	the University of Iowa but there is a Museum Studies Certificate. To me, 
	a museum curator and a librarian require similar skills, making this 
	certificate a logical choice. With that program, I decided to focus on collection 
	care and management and non-profit organization management.</p>
	<p>By my 5th year of college I had finished most of my History 
	Degree and most of my Museum Studies Certificate. I did not, however, have enough 
	credits left to be a full-time student. I remembered that I had enjoyed 
	computer programming at Iowa State so I decided to add some basic 
	computer classes to get me to 12 s.h. each semester. While exploring this, I 
	realized I only needed three more classes to have an Informatics Minor. 
	That is how in my 5th year of undergraduate study I added and completed a minor.</p>
	<img src="grad.jpg" alt="Graduation with Jen" style="float:left;padding-right:25px;width:150px;height:150px;">
	<p>I was pleased to graduate with the Class of 2016 with my B.A. with a 
	History Major, Informatics Minor, and Museum Studies Certificate. </p>
	<p>I had been accepted to the University of Iowa School of Library and 
	Information Science Class of 2018. Since beginning graduate school, I 
	have continued to focus on technology and have grown interested in 
	academic librarianship. I spent a semester with the Systems Librarian 
	as my mentor and have taken classes to expand my understanding of 
	technology. Going into this second year of the program I hope to expand 
	into more technology and to learn the ethics that accompany technology 
	and the vast collection of data that a library keeps about users.</p>

<div id="Org" class="tabcontent">
	<p>These organizations are listed in chronological order of when I joined them.</p>
	<h3>Scouting</h3>
	<img src="scouts.jpg" alt="Mom and I at Section Conclave" style="float:right;padding-bottom: 10px;padding-left:25px;width:150px;height:150px;">
	<p>My Scouting career followed the prescribed route. I started as a 
	Tiger Cub in 1st Grade and went until I turned 18 as a youth then 
	spent some time as a Scout Leader. Along the way I had earned the Arrow of Light, the highest award 
	for Cub Scouts, and the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest award for 
	Boy Scouts. I was selected for the Order of the Arrow and was designated 
	to receive the Vigil Honor, the highest honor that one can receive in the 
	Order of the Arrow. In terms of honors and awards I was successful. But, what the 
	Scouting Program gave me was a foundation in leadership, planning, 
	and great friends and memories. That was the true value of Scouting to me.</p>
	<h3>DeMolay</h3>
	<p>The organization that has by far done the most to shape me is the 
	Order of DeMolay. I joined in 2007 and the opportunities it has given 
	me are second to none. DeMolay provides a guide to become an upstanding 
	member of society, the freedom to experiment with ideas, word hard, fail, 
	succeed, and make memories and friends from around the globe.</p>
	<p>I am proud to say that it did all of that for me. I went from a new 
	member to the State Master Councilor for Iowa DeMolay, the leader of 
	the State of Iowa. The team that I was on planned events for the state 
	and I had the ability to travel to other states to visit their events.</p>
	<p>Now as an adult with the organization I work with the State Officer 
	Corps, the team of young men who form the leadership of the program, 
	and I also volunteer my time to maintain the Iowa DeMolay website. 
	Dedicating my time is the smallest of things I can do if I can help 
	another young person derive the same benefits I had from the organization</p>

	<h3>Freemasonry</h3>
	<p>Freemasonry has been a continuation of the principles and guide 
	that DeMolay started. I joined Fidelitas Lodge in Fairfax, Iowa in 2011. 
	Since that time, I have been continuing to meet new people, build the 
	relationships that DeMolay started, and enjoying the journey that Freemasonry is.</p>

<div id="Hobbies" class="tabcontent">
	<h3>Travel</h3>
	<p>I want to travel and see the world! On a graduate student's budget, 
	it is difficult to do. My favorite trip to date was to Washington D.C. 
	since it is steeped in history. I accidently ended up focusing my History 
	Major around the cultures of the North Sea and Mediterranean 
	Societies. Because of this, the places I most want to see are England, Germany, Ireland, 
	Italy, Greece, Denmark, and Egypt.</p>
	<h3>Photography</h3>
	<p>I approach my photography the same way I approach librarianship. 
	I am always trying to learn something new and get better at it. There 
	are so many different techniques and methods. Plus, there are so many 
	tools to learn! From photo editing software to camera settings to lenses 
	and filters. So much to learn!</p>
	<p>The work I am proudest of can be found on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jayhic/">Flickr</a>. </p>
	<h3>Maps and Globes</h3>
	<p>One of my favorite things to look at are maps and globes. To me, 
	they are equal parts art, tool, and history. They show how the cartographer 
	views the word with an artistic flair. A map is a tool that has been used 
	for centuries to find ones way around. And finally, maps and globes show 
	the history of the world. How countries have been shaped, formed, eliminated, 
	renamed, or otherwise have changed. I plan to own a nice globe one day and have it in my office. </p>
