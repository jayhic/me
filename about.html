<p>This is the part of the website where I attempt to humanize myself beyond 
just a CV and listing of my projects. I am a real person and I 
do real things that I really enjoy! My life has had ups, downs, left, and 
right turns. All of those have made me who I am today and I cannot think of 
a thing I would have done differently because I have no idea how that would 
have changed me!</p>
<p>Librarians and other people who work in libraries are all interesting 
people with a dizzying number of interests, hobbies, and experiences. But 
what I have noticed about them is that the majority took winding roads 
to become a librarian. Few said, "I wanted to be a librarian when I 
graduated high school." My path to where I am today is also a nonlinear 
path with changing goals, life experiences, and interests which makes me who 
I am today. These topics can be explored below.</p>

	<p>For my winding road through education I need to start out as a freshman 
	in high school. I took a class called Introduction to Engineering Design. 
	One of the first homework assignments was to research 10 or so different 
	fields of engineering and describe them. From that assignment, I learned 
	about Aerospace Engineering and it sounded awesome! After that the plan 
	for all of high school was Aerospace Engineering.</p>
	<p>My first choice of college was the United States Naval Academy and 
	Iowa State University was my second choice. I received two nominations 
	for admission to the Naval Academy, one from Senator Grassley and one 
	from former Senator Harkin. But, with an acceptance rate of 9% I was 
	not admitted. Thankfully, the State of Iowa uses a formula to determine 
	admission and if a student's score is high enough they are automatically 
	accepted. Mine was and following high school I began as an Aerospace 
	Engineering Student at Iowa State University.</p>

	<p>While at Iowa State I greatly enjoyed my freshman year. The program 
	talked about high level concepts of Aerospace Engineering, we did cool 
	projects, and basic computer programming with Fortran and MATLAB. When 
	my sophomore year started the class began to be taught what Aerospace 
	Engineering was and how that process gets done. It quickly became apparent 
	that that was not for me. I decided to withdraw from Iowa State.</p>
	<p>At this point in my education I had no idea what to do, as for the 
	last 5+ years of my life the plan had been Aerospace Engineering. That 
	summer I asked myself what did I enjoy and thinking over my high school 
	education I decided I had enjoyed History. The next thought I had was 
	"So, I get a history degree then what...What is my plan with that?" and 
	I decided on a librarian. My thought was I liked helping people learn 
	but I didn't want to grade homework so a librarian made sense to me.</p>
	<p>After a semester at Kirkwood Community College I transferred the 
	credits I had earned there and my credits from Iowa State to the 
	University of Iowa, they had a graduate program that I wanted to get 
	into so it made sense to go there for my undergraduate degree, and 
	began to work towards my History Major.</p>
	<p>There was not an undergraduate library science program or classes 
	the University of Iowa but there was a Museum Studies Certificate which 
	to me they are similar institutions. Old things, educational purposes, 
	non-profit, etc. etc. With that program, I decided to focus on collection 
	management and non-profit management. Working in the Paleo-repository 
	to do research on the origins of the collection and taking classes about 
	collection care and management which focused on proper storage, hazards, 
	and best practices. I also took classes about the business side of a museum 
	learning things such as grant writing, digital publishing, and understanding 
	mission statements, vision statements, budgets, and a SWOT Analysis.</p>
	<p>Finally, in my 5th year of college I had finished most of my History 
	Degree and most of my Museum Studies Certificate. I did not have enough 
	credits left to be a full-time student. Remembering that I had enjoyed 
	computer programming at Iowa State so I decided to add some basic 
	computer class to get me to 12 s.h. each semester. Looking at it I 
	realized I only needed three more classes to have an Informatics Minor. 
	That is how in my 5th year of undergraduate study I added and completed a minor.</p>
	<img src="grad.jpg" alt="Graduation with Jen" style="float:left;padding-right:25px;width:150px;height:150px;">
	<p>I was pleased to graduate with the Class of 2016 with my B.A. with a 
	History Major, Informatics Minor, and Museum Studies Certificate. </p>
	<p>I had been accepted to the University of Iowa School of Library and 
	Information Science Class of 2018. Since beginning graduate school, I 
	have continued to focus on technology and have grown interested in 
	academic librarianship. I spent a semester with the Systems Librarian 
	as a mentor and have taken classes to expand my understanding of 
	technology. Going into this second year of the program I hope to expand 
	into more technology and to learn the ethics that accompany technology 
	and the vast collection of data that a library keeps about users.</p>
