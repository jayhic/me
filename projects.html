<p>Please feel free to explore my projects. I have divided them into 
three categories 'Library Projects', 'School Projects', and 'Personal Projects'. 
Just select a tab below!</p>
<p>Library Projects are projects I have worked on as an employee. School Projects are 
projects that were major homework assignments or semester long projects. Finally, 
Personal Projects are those which I dedicate my time to for personal enjoyment or volunteer purposes. </p>

	<h3>Tool Guide</h3>
	<p>The biggest project that I have taken on at the Lichtenberger 
	Engineering Library is the maintaining of the Tool Library. At the 
	time of writing this the tool library consists of 172 tools that are 
	free for students to borrow. But it is ever growing with more being 
	added every few months. Each of the tools has a card that is kept with 
	it. That card has key information (i.e. what is included, links to 
	manuals, and a short description of its function). Those cards are 
	made with Microsoft Publisher. There is a tool binder, which acts as a 
	physical catalog. This is made using Microsoft Word. Finally, there 
	is an online presence for the Tool Library. That started off as a 
	Springshare LibGuide Site but it was transferred to a WordPress Site 
	to match the rest of the Engineering Library Website. If a tool is 
	added, the numbering system changes, or categories of tools changes 
	each of those resources must be updated to reflect the new change. 
	All three of those things have happened as the tool library has grown 
	we have had to come up new methods which have improved the Tool Library. </p>
	<p>The Tool Library WordPress can be found on the <a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/eng/tool-library/" target="_blank">Engineering Library Website</a>.</p>
	<h3>MECCA Week Research</h3>
	<p>This is a project that used my background as a historian and my 
	work on the Museum Studies Certificate. The Director of University 
	of Iowa Engineering Alumni Relations and Communications, Wendy Brentner, 
	has an archive of the University of Iowa MECCA Week Celebration, 
	which I had never heard of before this project. MECCA was a celebration 
	of the College of Engineering for much of the 1900's (1910-1980s). 
	I was required to take her records and add my own research, using skills I 
	have gained while working in the library. I ended up using microfilm, 
	digitized newspapers, a website that was made about alumni memories 
	of MECCA, and a few other physical resources that I found to add to her archive.</p>
	<p>The result of this project was a <a href="https://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/eng/mecca-exhibit/" target="_blank">blog</a> that is 
	hosted on the Engineering Website, an exhibit that was on display during the 
	month of March 2017 (a picture is found in the blog post), and a 
	<a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/eng/files/2017/06/MECCA_Week_Research_Project.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> of the 
	history that I found that was added to the archive and is hosted on the website as well. </p>
	<h3>Researcher 101</h3>
	<img src="research.jpg" alt="Researcher 101 Guide" style="float:right;padding-left:25px;width:150px;height:150px;">
	<p>The University of Iowa College of Engineering has 300+ Graduate 
	Students. This project started off as just to make a flyer for those 
	students discussing the resources that are available to aid them in 
	their research. But, then I had the idea why not make it a tool that 
	they could use by making it into a journal for them to keep their notes. 
	I wrote about the resources that were available, which takes up the 
	first approx. 10 pages, and the rest is grid paper for notes or sketching. Another department 
	on campus designed and produced the cover for the journal. They were 
	all bound in the Engineering Library. </p>
	<p>This project was exciting because it is a new way to promote library 
	resources that hadn't been done before and provided me with experience 
	on collaboration across campus departments!</p>
	<h3>Badging for Information Literacy</h3>
	<p>The project that will be evolving over this last year of graduate 
	school for me is using technology to teach basic information 
	literacy skills. Kari Kozak, Head of the Lichtenberger Engineering 
	Library, has been developing a series called "Detective Jones" which 
	are a series of "chose your own adventure" YouTube Videos that teach and
	explain information literacy concepts, such as the CRAAP Test.</p>
	<p>My part in this project has been researching how to recognize individuals using 
	badging for those complete the video series. The University 
	of Iowa uses Canvas Learning Management System. Researching I found 
	Badgr.io has a plug-in for Canvas. So, the decision was made that a 
	Canvas "class" be set up with modules for each video series/information literacy skill and then 
	Badgr.io awards badges once that module is completed. I am acting as 
	the course designer so I have been using Canvas to make the modules 
	and quizzes for the class.</p>

	<h3>Institutional Repository</h3>
	<img src="data.jpg" alt="SQL Query Outcomes" style="float:right;padding-left:25px;width:250px;height:250px;">
	<p>For the class Data Management and Visualization, the final project 
	was to use Medline data and construct an institutional research 
	repository, an on-line information system housing descriptions 
	of the activities of researchers. All the data was in a database 
	already and the group I was in, Team_A, consisted of Aaron M., Ben S., 
	Bharat S., John Y., and myself. This project used Java and SQL to produce the final product.</p>
	<p>My parts in the project were working at the command line to 
	remotely set up an Apache Tomcat Instance and then transfer the 
	files for our project to that server so it could be accessed. 
	Additionally, I wrote SQL queries to retrieve information from the 
	database and made the Java pages where those results would be displayed, 
	example to the right. I also included D3 visualizations into the project.</p>
	<p>The code I generated for it can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/jayhic/DataManagement" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

	<h3>This Website</h3>
	<p>This website is a project that I undertook to both be used as a 
	promotional tool for myself and to learn HTML and CSS. It is hosted 
	on GitHub Pages and all the code for it can be seen on my
	 <a href="https://github.com/jayhic/me" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>	
	<h3>Iowa DeMolay Website</h3>
	<p>One of the tasks that I do for Iowa DeMolay is maintain their 
	website. DeMolay International developed the framework for the website 
	with a simple file management system for the backend. I act as a content 
	creator and website manager. The front end for that website can be found at 
	<a href="http://iademolay.org/" target="_blank">IADeMolay.org</a>.</p>
	<h3>Iowa Inquisitor</h3>
	<p>Another thing I do for Iowa DeMolay, is act as the editor for 
	the Iowa Inquisitor. It is the monthly e-Newsletter for Iowa DeMolay. 
	It is written by the State Officers, the young men who lead DeMolay 
	in Iowa. The Inquisitor is the newest edition to the communication 
	for the state. Past editions can be found on the 
	<a href="http://iademolay.org/en/page.php?id=112" target="_blank">Iowa DeMolay Website</a>.</p>
