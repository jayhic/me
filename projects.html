<p>Please feel free to explore my projects. I have divided them into 
three categories 'Library Projects', 'School Projects', and 'Personal Projects'. 
Just select a tab below!</p>
<p>Library Projects are projects I have worked on as an employee. School Projects are 
projects that were major homework assignments or semester long projects. Finally, 
Personal Projects are those which I dedicate my time to for personal enjoyment or volunteer purposes. </p>

	<h3>Tool Guide</h3>
	<p>The biggest project that I have taken on at the Lichtenberger 
	Engineering Library is the maintaining of the Tool Library. At the 
	time of writing this the tool library consists of 172 tools that are 
	free for students to borrow. But it is ever growing with more being 
	added every few months. Each of the tools has a card that is kept with 
	it. That card has key information (i.e. what is included, links to 
	manuals, and a short description of its function). Those cards are 
	made with Microsoft Publisher. There is a tool binder, which acts as a 
	physical catalog. This is made using Microsoft Word. Finally, there 
	is an online presence for the Tool Library. That started off as a 
	Springshare LibGuide Site but it was transferred to a WordPress Site 
	to match the rest of the Engineering Library Website. If a tool is 
	added, the numbering system changes, or categories of tools changes 
	each of those resources must be updated to reflect the new change. 
	All three of those things have happened as the tool library has grown 
	we have had to come up new methods which have improved the Tool Library. </p>
	<p>The Tool Library WordPress can be found on the <a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/eng/tool-library/" target="_blank">Engineering Library Website</a>.</p>
	<h3>MECCA Week Research</h3>
	<p>This is a project that used my background as a historian and my 
	work on the Museum Studies Certificate. The Director of University 
	of Iowa Engineering Alumni Relations and Communications, Wendy Brentner, 
	has an archive of the University of Iowa MECCA Week Celebration, 
	which I had never heard of before this project. MECCA was a celebration 
	of the College of Engineering for much of the 1900â€™s (1910-1980s). 
	I was required to take her records and add my own research, using skills I
	 have gained while working in the library. I ended up using microfilm, 
	 digitized newspapers, a website that was made about alumni memories 
	 of MECCA, and a few other physical resources that I found to add to her archive.</p>
	<p>The result of this project was a <a href="https://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/eng/mecca-exhibit/" target="_blank">blog</a> that is 
	hosted on the Engineering Website, an exhibit that was on display during the 
	month of March 2017 (a picture is found in the blog post), and a 
	<a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/eng/files/2017/06/MECCA_Week_Research_Project.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> of the 
	history that I found that was added to the archive and is hosted on the website as well. </p>

	<h3>This Website</h3>
	<p>This website is a project that I undertook to both be used as a 
	promotional tool for myself and to learn HTML and CSS. It is hosted 
	on GitHub Pages and all the code for it can be seen on my
	 <a href="https://github.com/jayhic/me" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>	
	<h3>Iowa DeMolay Website</h3>
	<p>One of the tasks that I do for Iowa DeMolay is maintain their 
	website. DeMolay International developed the framework for the website 
	with a PHP file management system for the backend. I act as a content 
	creator and website manager. The front end for that website can be found at 
	<a href="http://iademolay.org/" target="_blank">IADeMolay.org</a>.</p>
	<h3>Iowa Inquisitor</h3>
	<p>Another thing I do for Iowa DeMolay, is act as the editor for 
	the Iowa Inquisitor. It is the monthly e-Newsletter for Iowa DeMolay. 
	It is written by the State Officers, the young men who lead DeMolay 
	in Iowa. The Inquisitor is the newest edition to the communication 
	for the state. Past editions can be found on the 
	<a href="http://iademolay.org/en/page.php?id=112" target="_blank">Iowa DeMolay Website</a>.</p>
